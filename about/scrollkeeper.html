            <p>
                I am a man of diverse interests and expertise. My passions
                span the spectrum from natural history to the fine arts, and
                I have spent my life cultivating a deep appreciation for a
                wide variety of subjects. From a young age, I have had an
                unquenchable curiosity and a voracious appetite for
                knowledge, which I have honed through extensive reading,
                studying, and hands-on experience. My love for learning has
                led me down many paths and allowed me to experience things I
                thought once to be impossible.
                <br><br>
                I am first and foremost a devout Muslim. It is my opinion
                that the world in which we reside could not have come to be
                by chance; there is irrefutable evidence of intelligent
                design by the hands of an omnipotent, eternal entity beyond
                our comprehension: Allah, or as some may call Him, God. I
                believe that the Qur'an was revealed to mankind through the
                angel Jibreel, and that it carries the one Truth. The
                preservation of religion precedes the preservation of all
                other things in life.
                <br><br>
                Returning to my interests - they do not stop there. I am an
                accomplished programmer and artist with a keen eye for
                detail and a deep appreciation of the beauty of the world
                surrounding us. I am equally at home in the domain of
                philosophy and theology, where I have spent many hours
                contemplating the nature of the Divine and the purpose of
                life. I am an avid reader and writer, with a passion for
                poetry and literature, and I greatly respect the power of
                words to inspire people and instill goodness in their
                hearts.
                <br><br>

                In addition to my intellectual pursuits, I have a love for
                the physical; everyday I further sharpen my body to the same
                extent that I hone my mind. I enjoy spending time in nature,
                exploring the wilderness and discovering new things about
                the world around me. I greatly appreciate the natural world
                and wish to protect it for future generations.
                <br><br>

                Throughout my life, I have been deeply commited to the
                preservation and spread of knowledge. It is for this reason
                that I have created this Library as an archive of data that
                can be accessed and learned from by all, in the hopes that
                it will help restore the humanity of the Internet. I long
                for a return to the Golden Age, where the web served as a
                platform for sharing knowledge and building meaningful
                connections with its inhabitants. I see the current state of
                the Web as a far cry from that ideal, where corporations
                have taken over and inundated every page with advertisements
                designed to manipulate and exploit users.
                <br><br>

                As I reflect on my life's journey and the many paths that I
                have travelled, I am struck by the profound
                interconnectedness of things. The natural world, the divine,
                and humanity itself are all intertwined in ways that are
                beautifully complex. And despite the many challenges that we
                face as a global community, I remain hopeful and committed
                to the pursuit of knowledge and understanding.
                <br><br>

                In a world that often seems filled with division and strife,
                it is easy to become disillusioned and cynical. But I
                believe that there is still much to be gained from the
                pursuit of the Truth. After all, the end goal of reason and
                intellect is the perception of Truth, which is by extension
                the highest purpose that the human soul can hope to achieve
                (Al-Ghazali, The Alchemy of Happiness). By striving to
                understand and appreciate the creations of the Lord, we can
                connect more deeply with ourselves and one another.
                <br><br>

                Ultimately, I hope that my life's work will contribute in
                some small way to a brighter, more harmonious future for
                all, whether through my passion for natural history, my
                creative endeavours, or my efforts to archive and preserve
                the Truth.
                <br><br>

                As I continue on this journey, I am reminded of a quote by
                the philosopher Lao Tzu: "The journey of a thousand miles
                begins with one step." May we all take that first step, and
                may it lead us ever closer to attaining and perceiving the
                Truth.
